# Big-Mart-Sales
A machine learning regression model to forecast item sales for a retail chain called “Big Mart.” Working with Kaggle’s labeled dataset  , the presenter walks through preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, and Random Forest
The Aim of the project Big-Mart-Sales is how to predict sales for a supermarket chain called Big Mart using machine learning in Python. Imagine you're working for a store and you want to know how much each item will sell.
We will be learning how to - 
1.Cleaning your data
2.Choosing the right model
3.Avoid overfitting
4.Evaluating the result
